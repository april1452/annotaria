The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of determining PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1</sub> in preschool age children and compares the results to the wheeze detection (PCW) method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>55 preschool children (ages 2.8&#x2013;6.4 years) with recurrent respiratory symptoms were recruited. Baseline spirometry and MCT were performed according to ATS/ERS guidelines and the following parameters were determined at baseline and after each inhalation: spirometry-indices, lung auscultation at tidal breathing, oxygen saturation, respiratory and heart rate. Comparison between PCW and PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1</sub> and clinical parameters at these end-points was done by paired Student's t-tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Thirty-six of 55 children (65.4%) successfully performed spirometry-sets up to the point of PCW. PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1</sub> occurred at a mean concentration of 1.70+/-2.01 while PCW occurred at a mean concentration of 4.37+/-3.40 mg/ml (p &lt; 0.05). At PCW, all spirometry-parameters were markedly reduced: FVC by 41.3+/-16.4% (mean +/-SD); FEV<sub>1</sub> by 44.7+/-14.5%; PEFR by 40.5+/-14.5 and FEF<sub>25&#x2013;75</sub> by 54.7+/-14.4% (P &lt; 0.01 for all parameters). This reduction was accompanied by de-saturation, hyperpnoea, tachycardia and a response to bronchodilators.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Determination of PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1</sub> by spirometry is feasible in many preschool children. PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1</sub> often appears at lower provocation dose than PCW. The lower dose may shorten the test and encourage participation. Significant decrease in spirometry indices at PCW suggests that PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1</sub> determination may be safer.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Measurements of bronchial hyper-reactivity (BHR) have provided insight into the physiological basis of asthma, and provide a tool for asthma diagnosis, assessment of asthma severity and response to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The bronchial provocation tests require an objective outcome measurement that reflects airway function. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) has been standardized to measure changes in airway caliber that occur with bronchial provocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the Methacholine challenge test (MCT), the provocative concentration reducing FEV<sub>1 </sub>by 20% from baseline (PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1</sub>) is considered the end point of the test. Traditionally, spirometry in young children has been difficult to achieve. Therefore, techniques that do not require cooperation (i.e., detection of wheeze during normal breathing, a fall of 5% in O<sub>2</sub>-saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>), or an increase of 50% in respiratory rate and/or heart rate) have been used as alternative end points in bronchial provocation tests in the preschool age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recently it has been shown that young children can be taught to perform reliable forced expiratory maneuvers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Yet, it is unclear whether these young children have the drive to perform and tolerate repetitive reproducible spirometry-sets that are measured during the interval between inhalations. Concentration of methacholine (MCH) causing wheeze, a fall of 5% in O<sub>2</sub>- Saturation, an increase of 50% in respiratory rate and/or heart rate (PCW) and PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>were compared in school children and a good correlation was found between the two methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>This study assesses the ability of young asthmatic preschool children to cooperate with repetitive spirometry-sets during MCT, and thereby allow determination of PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>in comparison with PCW.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Consecutive preschool children referred to the Pediatric Pulmonary Clinic, Meyer Children's Hospital, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, over a 6-month period were recruited.

A parent and the investigating team (a pediatric pulmonary physician, respiratory physiologist and technician) were present throughout the test. MCT was performed according to published guidelines, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], with doubling doses of fresh Methacholine solutions (0.06 to 8.00 mg/ml) dissolved in saline. Solutions were driven by compressed air of 5 l/min flow (giving a mean output of 0.4 ml/min), and nebulized using a Hudson nebulizer (Hudson RCI, Temecula, CA, USA). Inhalations were performed using a facemask while the child was sitting up straight and breathing normally. Nebulized Methacholine was inhaled for 2 minutes, with 5-minute intervals between doses, until the maximal concentration or the end point was reached. To ensure safety in light of the risk of airway closer, the MCH increment was only half the usual amount when transient wheeze or cough was noted, keeping in mind that the accumulative dose is affected by this manipulation. Oxygen saturation and heart rate were monitored continuously by pulse oximetry (Biox 3700e; Ohmeda). A single observer (LB) performed auscultation for 20 seconds over the trachea and two zones of both lungs (upper front and lower back) according to Springer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]</p><p>The following indices were considered "end of test": appearance of audible wheeze, a fall of &#x2265;5% in O<sub>2</sub>-saturation, or an increase of &#x2265;50% in respiratory rate and/or heart rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. At the "end of test", spirometric measurements were performed, followed by administration of nebulized Albuterol (2.5 mg).</p></sec><sec><title>Spirometry</title><p>Forced expiratory flow volume (FEFV) curves were measured with a ZAN100 commercial spirometer (ZAN Messgeraete GmbH, Oberthulba, Germany). Calibration was performed before the testing sessions. The curves were monitored on the computer screen to ensure best effort. Results were corrected to BTPS conditions. The software included an interactive animated computer game (SpiroGame<sup>&#xAE;</sup>) set by targets of the FEFV maneuver, combining forced inhalation preceding forced expiration, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and forced vital capacity (FVC) with emphasis on prolonged expiration. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] The targets were the extrapolated values derived from comparative data from older children, corrected for height. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] An experienced pulmonary technician instructed each child how to operate the game. Teaching time was limited to 15 minutes. On-line rejection of curves was based on visual inspection for "non-cooperation" errors and included: poor effort; incomplete expiration; cough; glottis closure. Curves had to show a rapid rise to peak flow, and gradual, smooth decline of flow down to residual volume. Baseline maneuvers were repeated to visually obtain best possible efforts on at least 3 technically acceptable FEFV curves. After obtaining baseline spirometry, MCT was performed. A duplicate spirometry set was performed immediately after auscultation. PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>was determined off line by the provocative concentration that reduced FEV<sub>1 </sub>by 20% from baseline. PC values were log-transformed before statistical analyses. Spirometry indices included FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, PEFR, forced expiratory flow at 50% FVC (FEF<sub>50</sub>), FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis and statistics</title><p>Three baseline spirometry curves were analyzed for acceptability criteria according to ATS/ERS guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and in comparison with similar data for preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These included: a) "Start of test" criteria: time to peak expiratory flow and backward extrapolated volume (Vbe) b) "End of test criteria": described by "total expiratory time" and the ratio of "no change in expiratory volume" to "total expiratory time" c) reproducibility (coefficient of variation) of the three baseline curves, calculated as SD/mean*100.</p><p>After inhalations, the curves were inspected visually online, and were analyzed offline in relation to baseline using paired t-test.

Eleven children failed spirometry and underwent MCT by auscultation only. Failure to perform spirometry was due to lack of comprehension (4 children) or failure to repeat spirometry after baseline measurements (7 children). Failure was not age dependent. Eight children refused to cooperate with either test. Thirty-six of 55 (65.5%) children performed the MCT with spirometry tests and with auscultation. Of these 36 children, eleven were 2.5&#x2013;3.9 years old, 15 were 4&#x2013;5 years old, and 10 were &gt;5 years old. Three children failed to produce FEV<sub>1 </sub>on the baseline measurements but were able to produce it after saline administration. In these children, post saline FEV<sub>1 </sub>measurements were considered as baseline. FEV<sub>1 </sub>at that point was &gt;75% predicted.

We found MCT was feasible in 65% of this group of wheezy preschool children. Children as young as 3 years old complied and cooperated with what seems to be a most fatiguing procedure. Baseline measurements met most of the ATS criteria for older children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and quality control studies on spirometry in preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We found that PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>correlates with PCW. However, PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>frequently precedes PCW. All spirometry parameters at PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>were significantly higher than those measured at PCW.</p><p>In this study, we used interactive spirometry games [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] with multiple spirometry targets, since single targeted games (usually peak expiratory flow targeted) have not fulfilled expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Our teaching method is supported by the findings that 65% of the children fully cooperated not only with baseline measurements but also with spirometry sets. Of note, 26 of the 36 children were younger than 5 years. Conforming quality control was necessary to proceed with the test. The quality control of baseline spirometry in our study met most ATS/ERS criteria concerning reproducibility and start of test criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and matched those reported for preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], encouraging us to continue with the MCT test. Vbe = 5%FVC found in our study is narrower than reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], as we have rejected in advance curves with Vbe &gt;5%FVC at the expense of success rate. It should be stressed that our work did not compare verbal coaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] or other spirometry games [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] as the preferable methodology for keeping the child going and performing repetitive spirometry sets.</p><p>The mean PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>of 1.96 &#xB1; 1.83 mg/ml found in our group reflects a mild degree of BHR, as we recruited children with mild asthmatic symptoms. Our findings for PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>are comparable to those of Hayden et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], who found a mean PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>at FEV<sub>0.5 </sub>of 2.49 &#xB1; 2.55 mg/ml in infants. Adinoff et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] reported a mean provocative dose of 3.0 mg/ml Methacholine in their preschool children and infants. Tepper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] et al. reported that infants with asthma-like respiratory symptoms might respond to MCH concentrations as low as 1.25 mg/ml. In that respect we found that PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>0.5 </sub>occurred at a mean concentration value of 1.29- &#xB1; 1.47 mg/ml, meaning that the responsiveness of the airways in the preschool age may be similar to that of infants, despite differences in the measurement techniques. It is important to note that PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>0.5 </sub>occurred at a significant mean lower concentration than PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>(1.96- &#xB1; 1.83 mg/ml; p &lt; 0.01), however, standardization is needed to accept the PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>0.5 </sub>value for the determination of hyper-reactive airways.</p><sec><title>PCW</title><p>We found that PCW occurred in our group at a mean concentration of 4.26 &#xB1; 3.31 mg/ml. PCW values in our study were much higher than the PCW (0.4 mg/ml) reported by Springer et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The difference may be attributed to inclusion of more severe asthmatics in their study group.</p></sec><sec><title>Spirometry at PCW</title><p>We found that PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>occurred at a lower concentration than PCW in most subjects. This finding is in agreement with several other studies comparing PCW detection to PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>in school age children. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, in none of these studies were spirometry measurements carried out to the point of wheeze. We expected to find a good correlation between the two tests (PCW = 1.2195*PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>+ 0.0288; R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.9733; p &lt; 0.005), yet the Blant and Altman analysis revealed that in children with higher mean provocation PCW dose (&#x2265;6 mg), the level of agreement between the methods was low, reflecting higher sensitivity of the PC<sub>20</sub> method, especially in mild airway reactivity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>We found that at PCW, FEFV curves visually seemed to be smaller and all parameters were reduced simultaneously (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), with a highly significant reduction in flows and volume parameters. The reduction in curve was gradual in most children, accompanied by an increase in respiratory symptoms (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), and responded to bronchodilators, and hence was not considered to reflect fatigue. To further strengthen this point a representative curve of one child illustrating, a poor effort performed at teaching process vs. end of test curve is shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. The poor-effort curve did not fulfill start of test criteria and is round while the "end of test curve" has an obstructed shape.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>A representative example of poor-effort forced expiratory flow-volume curves from one child. Baseline, Post challenge and poor effort during teaching process are presented.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2431-5-19-4"/></fig><p>The reduced FVC and flows are most likely due to a severe degree of airway narrowing involving small to medium airways that may be accompanied by air trapping, partial closure of airways and elevation in FRC. Reduced FVC may also be due to increased glottic narrowing due to MCH irritation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], but the flow volume curve was not suggestive of upper airway obstruction (trimmed PEFR). Alternatively, the upper airways response to methacholine may contribute to the increase in total respiratory resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This pattern occurred in some cases before appearance of wheeze or other clinical end-points. Indeed, in 9/36 subjects, the test was terminated due to oxygen desaturation or tachypnea rather than wheeze. Similar to our results, Sprikkelman et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] reported that wheeze was detected in only 33% of 15 school-age asthmatic children at PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1, </sub>and Springer et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] terminated the test without the presence of wheeze in 19.2% of young children. In this respect we would argue that FEV1 does make a contribution beyond simply asking the subject if they wheeze. Novitzki et al (4) found in 5&#x2013;8 year-old children that FEV<sub>1 </sub>is decreased by 33.3 &#xB1; 7.4% at PCW. Spence et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] reported a mean fall of 51 &#xB1; 14% from baseline FEV<sub>1 </sub>when wheeze appeared in their asthmatic older subjects. Our results strengthen these prior findings, and suggest that spirometric PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>may be achieved with inhalation of lower MCH concentrations than those used to achieve wheeze.</p><p>Measuring PCW during tidal volume breathing has the advantage that no active cooperation on the child's part is needed. Therefore the success rate of PCW is higher than spirometry (44/55 children). However, using PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>(or PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>0.5</sub>) can preclude inhalation of higher concentrations of MCH used to achieve wheeze, leading to alarmingly diminished flows found at PCW and a significant shortening of test time relative to PCW.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>is feasible in preschool asthmatic children when using respiratory games teaching techniques and that the children tolerate repetitive duplicate sets of spirometry maneuvers. PC<sub>20</sub>-FEV<sub>1 </sub>in preschool children appears to be as sensitive as in adults and school children. Yet, many questions remain open as to the usefulness of this test in a random sample of young children and/or how discriminating this test is as a diagnostic tool. It would also be necessary to assess the sensitivity of this test to various severities of disease. Further studies are needed for standardization and definition of methodological criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interest.</p><p>The SpiroGame program is privately patented in USA, granted to Dr. Vilozni.</p><p>Dr. Vilozni does not foresee any financial gain or loss, now or in the future from publishing this manuscript.
