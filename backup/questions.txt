QUESTIONS

1. clarify process
   web app -> create annotation -> annotation to json object -> send json to server -> server changes to turtle
   -> server sends to fuseki (???) using insert query

2. create annotation: widgets and IRIs
   instance widgets---------------------------------------------------
   choice: query to foaf/dbpedia/icd/biblioteca firenze -> show results -> user select -> create note
   instance: user input -> create json -> send json to server -> server changes to turtle (????) how to create IRI from user-created instance -> send to fuseki

   create gerneric URI for al classes (people, authors, etc)
   REST: GET uri
   to create.. 2 ways (client decides to create identifier, i.e. fiscal code PUT http://..../person/12345
                       otherwise server creates identifier if id is not inherently unique
                       POST ..../person/ newID
                       serverside app sees post to collection, decides to create new instance return record with new id

   dbpedia widgets: --------------------------------------------------
   user enters a search term -> ajax query to dbpedia -> show results (should we filter?) -> user select -> create note
