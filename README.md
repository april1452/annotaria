---------

this is the local version of the app before we uploaded annotaria onto a department computer and unibo server. thus it does not have the bug fixes nor additional logic that was added after testing it on the university server. because this project was only worked on for a period of 3 weeks, MVC organization is rough and server-side flask framework is still in testing.
